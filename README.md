### Just Another Daily Co~n~(de)versation

People: "you like coding too much"

Me: "WTH no I dont"

Also another me talking to wife: "We should name our daughter after 1st woman programmer in this world"

Wife: "Lets name her Adalova, after Ada Lovelace"

another me: (without hesitation) "agree"

Also another me asking wife again: "I want to create a tshirt for her, should add coding stuff to it"

Wife: "okay"

What happened couple days later will surprise you. see [here](./692b77ab-9911-40da-b7a5-774ccd967c1c.JPG)
